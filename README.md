## Running the example

The easiest and fastest way to get up and running is with Teams Toolkit as your development guide. To use Teams Toolkit to automate setup and debugging, please [continue below](#using-teams-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code).

Otherwise, if you only want to run the bot locally and build manually, please checkout the [BotFramework Emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp) from Microsoft.


## Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The simplest way to run this example in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
2. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
3. Install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
4. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
5. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this example's directory from the repo
6. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have **permissions** to upload custom apps
7. Verify that the Teams Toolkit extension is connected to your Teams account from the above step.
8. In the debugger, play the Debug (Edge) script
9. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
10. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.
